### Homeworks
- General homework submission policy (for ALL Homeworks):
   - You may submit your homework to the instructor (Email).
   - To submit your homework, make sure to include: (a) Your name in Arabic, (b) Title (like: HW1, HW2 ), (c) Submission date, and (d) files that show your work. If you are required to submit a VHDL code, then you should submit a text file showing your code.
   - Register your own online account with (https://www.edaplayground.com).
   - For HDL code, you have to submit simulations results (the output of the circuit). 
   - Late homework submissions (48 Hours) will receive a maximum grade of 50 out of 100. Late homework submissions (more than 48 Hours) will receive a maximum grade of 25 out of 100..

- HW1: (Due on: Feb 7th, 2026)
    - Prepare a presentation (and discussion) about Register-Transfer Level Design (Chapter 2 - Reference 2).    
    - Run and implement the code mentioned in Chapter 2 - Reference 2 online and shared the simulation results (as a text file).
    - Notes: (a) You can find useful materials about this topic Chapter 8 - Reference 1. (b) Google offers one of best applications for slides (online).

  
- HW2: Due on (Feb 14th, 2026)
     - (1) Ref4-Example 2.1: Add a multiplexer to the circuit in order to select which component to present on the output. A student should show the schematic and VHDL code, simulation, and any related docs.
     - (2) Ref4-Example 3.4: Unsigned/Signed Multiplier. Modify this circuit by adding an adder to the multiplier. Also you add a multiplexer at the output of the circuit to select between adder and multiplexer. A student should show  the schematic and VHDL code, simulation, and any related docs.
     - (3) Design a 2-bit full-adder using 2x1 multiplexers. Feel free to use any number of these multiplexers. A student should show the schematic and VHDL code, simulation, and any related docs.


  


### Exams
- General exam policy (for ALL Exams)
