### Homeworks
- General homework submission policy (for ALL Homeworks):
   - You may submit your homework to (wahhab.albazrqa@uokufa.edu.iq).
   - To submit your homework, make sure to include: (a) Your name in Arabic, (b) Title (like: HW1, HW2 ), (c) Submission date, and (d) A text file (.c) to show your C code.
   - Late homework submissions (48 Hours) will receive a maximum grade of 50 out of 100. Late homework submissions (more than 48 Hours) will receive a maximum grade of 25 out of 100..

- HW1: Due on (Oct 6th, 2025)
  - (1) Write a C program that displays prime numbers between two intervals (numbers).
  - (2) Design and implement a simple calculator program based on C code.

- HW2: Due on (Oct 13th, 2025)
   - (1) Write a program that uses printf to display the following picture on the screen: [Picture Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/132I-wZQ_E6KVKTJolZiyK6OV8fIICELg/view?usp=drive_link)
   - (2) On the reference textbook, implement 5 out of 12 programming projects page (122).
- HW3: Due on (Oct 20th,2025) 
   - (1) Write a C code program that swaps two integers without using a template integer.
   - (2) Write a C code program that accepts a float matrix M (8*19) from user's input and finds the transpose of M.
   - (3) Write a C code program that writes a float matrix A (8*19) to a text file, read it to a new matrix B, and prints B on the output screen.
   - (4) Write a C code program that accepts an integer (H) from user's input and detects occurance of three ones in a row (111) in H. For example, if the user input is 71, which is 0b1000111 in binary, your program outputs: Yes.. There's a three ones in a row. If the user input is 70, which is 0b1000110 in binary, your program outputs: Not found. If we need to detect three zeros in a raw, what should be changed in your code?
- HW4: Due on (Oct 27th,2025)
   - Write a code program that uses C structures to hold students data (10 students). Your program should read students data from user input. Then, use functions to write C structures to a C file. You should try the following: (1) Try both types of file: text and binary, (2) Create C structures at run time using dynamic memory allocation, and (3) Use C files to store students data.
 - HW5 Due on (Nov 1st,2025): Note there are links (at the bottom of this website) which contain useful C code that helps students to address this homework.
     - Write a C code program that implements a stack data structure. The basic operations you should include: createStack(), Push(), Pop(), stackSize(), PrintStack().
     - Write a C code program that implements a queue data structure. The basic operations you should include: createQueue(), EnQueue(), DeQueue(), QueueSize(), PrintQueue();
     - Write a C code program that implements a linked list data structure. The basic operations you should include: AddNode(), DeleteNode(), LinkedListSize(), FindElement(); 
     - Write a C code program that creates a linked list data structure name it (List1). Then, write a C code to reverse List1 in a new linked list (List2). For example, List1 = 2,7,9,12,17. List2 should be: 17,12,9,7,2.
     - Write a C code program that reverses an array of characters using stack data structure. For example for the array A: b,y,u,r,p. The reverse is B: p,r,u,y,b.
