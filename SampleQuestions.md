### Questions: Comb. Logic Circuits
- (1) Ref4: Provide a solution and simulation results for the following examples of chapter2 and chapter3:
   - Page 20 ==> Example 2.1
   - Page 21 ==> Example 2.3
   - Page 23 ==> Example 2.4
   - Page 50 ==> Example 3.1, Example 3.2.

- (2) Reading article: Page 24 Section 2.8 Coding Guidelines
- (3) Ref1: Provide a solution and VHDL code for the following problems of chapter4: (4.6, 4.7, 4.10, 4.11, 4.20, 4.21, 4.25, 4.26, 4.27, 4.28, 4.31, 4.32, 4.33, 4.34, 4.35).

### Questions: Seq. Logic Circuits
- (1) Design a four-bit shift register with parallel load using D flip-flops. There are two control inputs: shift and load; we refer to them as: S and L. When SL = 10, the content of the register is shifted by one position to the left. The content is shifted to the right when SL=11. New data is loaded into the register when SL = 01. The content of the register does not change when SL = 00. Provide VHDL code for your design.
